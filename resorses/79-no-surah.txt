1: By those ˹angels˺ stripping out ˹evil souls˺ harshly,

2: and those pulling out ˹good souls˺ gently,

3: and those gliding ˹through heavens˺ swiftly,

4: and those taking the lead vigorously,

5: and those conducting affairs ˹obediently˺!

6: ˹Consider˺ the Day ˹when˺ the quaking Blast will come to pass,[1]
	[1] The first Blast will cause everyone to die except those spared by Allah. Then the second one will cause the dead to come to life for judgment. See [39:68]. 

7: followed by a second Blast.

8: ˹The deniers’˺ hearts on that Day will be trembling ˹in horror˺,

9: with their eyes downcast.

10: ˹But now˺ they ask ˹mockingly˺, “Will we really be restored to our former state,

11: even after we have been reduced to decayed bones?”

12: Adding, “Then such a return would be a ˹total˺ loss ˹for us˺!”

13: But indeed, it will take only one ˹mighty˺ Blast,

14: and at once they will be above ground.

15: Has the story of Moses reached you ˹O Prophet˺?

16: His Lord called him in the sacred valley of Ṭuwa,

17: ˹commanding,˺ “Go to Pharaoh, for he has truly transgressed ˹all bounds˺.

18: And say, ‘Would you ˹be willing to˺ purify yourself,

19: and let me guide you to your Lord so that you will be in awe ˹of Him˺?’”

20: Then Moses showed him the great sign,[1]
	[1] The staff turning into a snake. See [20:17-23]

21: but he denied and disobeyed ˹Allah˺,

22: then turned his back, striving ˹against the truth˺.

23: Then he summoned ˹his people˺ and called out,

24: saying, “I am your lord, the most high!”

25: So Allah overtook him, making him an example in this life and the next.

26: Surely in this is a lesson for whoever stands in awe of ˹Allah˺.

27: Which is harder to create

28: raising it high and forming it flawlessly.

29: He dimmed its night, and brought forth its daylight.

30: As for the earth, He spread it out as well,[1]
	[1] The Arabic verb daḥa also suggests that the earth is egg-shaped. The noun form diḥya is still used in some Arab dialects to mean an egg. Based on [2:29], [41:9-12], and [79:27-33], Allah ordained both realms, then formed the earth and created its provisions, then formed the heaven into seven heavens—all in six ˹heavenly˺ Days. See footnote for [7:54].

31: bringing forth its water and pastures

32: and setting the mountains firmly ˹upon it˺—

33: all as ˹a means of˺ sustenance for you and your animals.

34: But, when the Supreme Disaster[1] comes to pass—
	[1] This is the second Blast which will cause the dead to come to life for judgment. See [39:68].

35: the Day every person will remember all ˹their˺ striving,

36: and the Hellfire will be displayed for all to see—

37: then as for those who transgressed

38: and preferred the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world,

39: the Hellfire will certainly be ˹their˺ home.

40: And as for those who were in awe of standing before their Lord and restrained themselves from ˹evil˺ desires,

41: Paradise will certainly be ˹their˺ home.

42: They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the Hour, “When will it be?”

43: But it is not for you to tell its time.[1]
	[1] Another possible translation: “What is this question? You ˹O Prophet˺ are one of its signs.” It is believed—based on authentic narrations from the Prophet—that he (ﷺ) is one of the signs of the Day of Judgment. 

44: That knowledge rests with your Lord ˹alone˺.

45: Your duty is only to warn whoever is in awe of it.

46: On the Day they see it, it will be as if they had stayed ˹in the world˺ no more than one evening or its morning.
