Al-Ikhlas [The Sincerity]


1: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He is Allah—One ˹and Indivisible˺;

2: Allah—the Sustainer ˹needed by all˺.

3: He has never had offspring, nor was He born.

4: And there is none comparable to Him.”[1]
	[1] As mentioned in the Introduction, the Quran has three main themes: 1. Stories. 2. Muslim teachings. 3. And belief in the unseen. Since Sûrah 112 covers the third theme, the Prophet (ﷺ) says in a ḥadîth collected by Bukhâri and Muslim that reading this sûrah equals reading one third of the Quran.
