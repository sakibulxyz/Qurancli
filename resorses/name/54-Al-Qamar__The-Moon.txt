Al-Qamar [The Moon]


1: The Hour has drawn near and the moon was split ˹in two˺.[1]
	[1] The Meccan pagans challenged the Prophet (ﷺ) to have the moon split in two if he wanted them to believe in him. The moon was split, and then re-joined, as reported by several eyewitnesses, but still the pagans refused to believe, calling this miracle “sheer magic.”

2: Yet, whenever they see a sign, they turn away,[1] saying, “Same old magic!”
	[1] A miracle (usually referred to as a ‘sign’ in the Quran) can be defined as an extraordinary event manifesting divine intervention in human affairs. Every prophet was given miracles to prove he was commissioned by Allah. Moses (ﷺ) was given the miracle of the staff and many others. Jesus (ﷺ) gave life to the dead and healed the blind and the leper. And Muḥammad (ﷺ) received the Quran, a literary miracle, to challenge the masters of Arabic eloquence. The Prophet (ﷺ) performed some other miracles such as splitting the moon, multiplying food and water, and healing some of his companions.

3: They rejected ˹the truth˺ and followed their own desires—and every matter will be settled—

4: even though the stories ˹of destroyed nations˺ that have already come to them are a sufficient deterrent.

5: ˹This Quran is˺ profound ˹in˺ wisdom, but warnings are of no benefit ˹to them˺.

6: So turn away from them ˹O Prophet˺. ˹And wait for˺ the Day ˹when˺ the caller[1] will summon ˹them˺ for something horrifying.[2]
	[1] Angel Isrâfîl will blow the Trumpet, causing all to be raised from the dead for judgment.
	[2] i.e., the Judgment. 

7: With eyes downcast, they will come forth from the graves as if they were swarming locusts,

8: rushing towards the caller. The disbelievers will cry, “This is a difficult Day!”

9: Before them, the people of Noah denied ˹the truth˺ and rejected Our servant, calling ˹him˺ insane. And he was intimidated.

10: So he cried out to his Lord, “I am helpless, so help ˹me˺!”

11: So We opened the gates of the sky with pouring rain,

12: and caused the earth to burst with springs, so the waters met for a fate already set.

13: We carried him on that ˹Ark made˺ of planks and nails,

14: sailing under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes—a ˹fair˺ punishment on behalf of the one ˹they˺ denied.

15: We certainly left this[1] as a sign. So is there anyone who will be mindful?
	[1] The Flood or the Ark. 

16: Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My punishment and warnings!

17: And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember. So is there anyone who will be mindful?

18: ’Ȃd ˹also˺ rejected ˹the truth˺. Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My punishment and warnings!

19: Indeed, We sent against them a furious wind,[1] on a day of unrelenting misery,
	[1] lit., a bitter and screaming wind. 

20: that snatched people up, leaving them like trunks of uprooted palm trees.

21: Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My punishment and warnings!

22: And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember. So is there anyone who will be mindful?

23: Thamûd rejected the warnings ˹as well˺,

24: arguing, “How can we follow one ˹average˺ human being from among us? We would then truly be misguided and insane.

25: Has the revelation been sent down ˹only˺ to him out of ˹all of˺ us? In fact, he is a boastful liar.”

26: ˹It was revealed to Ṣâliḥ,˺ “They will soon know who the boastful liar is.

27: We are sending the she-camel as a test for them. So watch them ˹closely˺, and have patience.

28: And tell them that the ˹drinking˺ water must be divided between them ˹and her˺, each taking a turn to drink ˹every other day˺.”

29: But they roused a companion of theirs, so he dared to kill ˹her˺.

30: Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My punishment and warnings!

31: Indeed, We sent against them ˹only˺ one ˹mighty˺ blast, leaving them like the twigs of fence-builders.

32: And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember. So is there anyone who will be mindful?

33: The people of Lot ˹also˺ rejected the warnings.

34: We unleashed upon them a storm of stones. As for ˹the believers of˺ Lot’s family, We delivered them before dawn

35: as a blessing from Us. This is how We reward whoever gives thanks.

36: He had already warned them of Our ˹crushing˺ blow but they disputed the warnings.

37: And they even demanded his angel-guests from him,[1] so We blinded their eyes. ˹And they were told,˺ “Taste then My punishment and warnings!”
	[1] Who came in the form of handsome men. 

38: And indeed, by the early morning they were overwhelmed by an unrelenting torment.

39: ˹Again they were told,˺ “Taste now My punishment and warnings!”

40: And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember. So is there anyone who will be mindful?

41: And indeed, the warnings ˹also˺ came to the people of Pharaoh.

42: ˹But˺ they rejected all of Our signs, so We seized them with the ˹crushing˺ grip of the Almighty, Most Powerful.

43: Now, are you ˹Meccan˺ disbelievers superior to those ˹destroyed peoples˺? Or have you ˹been granted˺ immunity ˹from punishment˺ in divine Books?

44: Or do they say, “We are all ˹a˺ united ˹front˺, bound to prevail.”?

45: ˹Soon˺ their united front will be defeated and ˹forced to˺ flee.[1]
	[1] This was later fulfilled in the Battle of Badr. 

46: Better yet, the Hour is their appointed time—and the Hour will be most catastrophic and most bitter.

47: Indeed, the wicked are ˹entrenched˺ in misguidance, and ˹are bound for˺ blazes.

48: On the Day they will be dragged into the Fire on their faces, ˹they will be told,˺ “Taste the touch of Hell!”[1]
	[1] Saqar is one of the names of Hell.

49: Indeed, We have created everything, perfectly preordained.

50: Our command[1] is but a single word,[2] done in the blink of an eye.
	[1] To bring anything into being. 
	[2] “Be!” And it is!

51: We have already destroyed the likes of you. So will any ˹of you˺ be mindful?

52: Everything they have done is ˹listed˺ in ˹their˺ records.

53: Every matter, small and large, is written ˹precisely˺.

54: Indeed, the righteous will be amid Gardens and rivers,[1]
	[1] Rivers of water, milk, honey, and wine. See [47:15].

55: at the Seat of Honour in the presence of the Most Powerful Sovereign.
