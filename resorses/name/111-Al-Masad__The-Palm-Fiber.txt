Al-Masad [The Palm Fiber]


1: May the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and he ˹himself˺ perish!

2: Neither his wealth nor ˹worldly˺ gains will benefit him.

3: He will burn in a flaming Fire,

4: and ˹so will˺ his wife, the carrier of ˹thorny˺ kindling,[1]
	[1] Since she used to carry thorny branches and throw them in the way of the Prophet (ﷺ), she will be carrying firewood in Hell.

5: around her neck will be a rope of palm-fibre.[1]
	[1] This was one of the earliest sûrahs revealed of the Quran. Paradoxically, for Abu Lahab to disprove the Quran, all he had to do was accept Islam because this verse condemns him to Hell.
