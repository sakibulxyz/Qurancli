Al-Inshiqaq [The Sundering]


1: When the sky bursts open,

2: obeying its Lord as it must,

3: and when the earth is flattened out,

4: and ejects ˹all˺ its contents[1] and becomes empty,
	[1] i.e., treasures and dead bodies.

5: obeying its Lord as it must, ˹surely you will all be judged˺.

6: O humanity! Indeed, you are labouring restlessly towards your Lord, and will ˹eventually˺ meet the consequences.

7: As for those who are given their record in their right hand,

8: they will have an easy reckoning,

9: and will return to their people joyfully.

10: And as for those who are given their record ˹in their left hand˺ from behind their backs,

11: they will cry for ˹instant˺ destruction,

12: and will burn in the blazing Fire.

13: For they used to be prideful among their people,

14: thinking they would never return ˹to Allah˺.

15: Yes ˹they would˺! Surely their Lord has always been All-Seeing of them.

16: So, I do swear by the twilight!

17: And by the night and whatever it envelops!

18: And by the moon when it waxes full!

19: You will certainly pass from one state to another.[1]
	[1] You will pass from life to death and from death to resurrection, from well-being to sickness and from sickness to well-being, from poverty to richness and from richness to poverty, etc.

20: So what is the matter with them that they do not believe,

21: and when the Quran is recited to them, they do not bow down ˹in submission˺?[1]
	[1] lit., they do not prostrate.

22: In fact, the disbelievers persist in denial.

23: But Allah knows best whatever they hide.

24: So give them good news of a painful punishment.

25: But those who believe and do good will have a never-ending reward.
