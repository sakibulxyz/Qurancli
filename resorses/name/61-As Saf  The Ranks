As-Saf [The Ranks]


1: Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth glorifies Allah. For He ˹alone˺ is the Almighty, All-Wise.

2: O believers! Why do you say what you do not do?

3: How despicable it is in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do!

4: Surely Allah loves those who fight in His cause in ˹solid˺ ranks as if they were one concrete structure.

5: ˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Why do you hurt me when you already know I am Allah’s messenger to you?” So when they ˹persistently˺ deviated, Allah caused their hearts to deviate. For Allah does not guide the rebellious people.

6: And ˹remember˺ when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O children of Israel! I am truly Allah’s messenger to you, confirming the Torah which came before me, and giving good news of a messenger after me whose name will be Aḥmad.”[1] Yet when the Prophet came to them with clear proofs, they said, “This is pure magic.”
	[1] " Aḥmad is another name for Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ). Both are derived from ḥa-ma-da which means ‘praise.’ Some Muslim scholars believe this verse refers to John 14:16, where Jesus says: “And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another periklytos, to be with you forever.” Periklytos is a Greek word that means ‘the praised one.’ The name of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ) appears several times in the Gospel of Barnabas, which is deemed apocryphal by Christian authorities.",

7: Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies about Allah when invited to submit ˹to Him˺?[1] For Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
	[1] Submission to Allah means ‘Islam’ in Arabic. 

8: They wish to extinguish Allah’s light with their mouths, but Allah will ˹certainly˺ perfect His light, even to the dismay of the disbelievers.

9: He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with ˹true˺ guidance and the religion of truth, making it prevail over all others, even to the dismay of the polytheists.

10: O believers! Shall I guide you to an exchange that will save you from a painful punishment?

11: ˹It is to˺ have faith in Allah and His Messenger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best for you, if only you knew.

12: He will forgive your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and ˹house you in˺ splendid homes in the Gardens of Eternity. That is the ultimate triumph.

13: ˹He will also give you˺ another favour that you long for

14: O believers! Stand up for Allah, as Jesus, son of Mary, asked the disciples, “Who will stand up with me for Allah?” The disciples replied, “We will stand up for Allah.” Then a group from the Children of Israel believed while another disbelieved. We then supported the believers against their enemies, so they prevailed.
