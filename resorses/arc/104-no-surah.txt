1: Woe to every backbiter, slanderer,

2: who amasses wealth ˹greedily˺ and counts it ˹repeatedly˺,

3: thinking that their wealth will make them immortal!

4: Not at all! Such a person will certainly be tossed into the Crusher.

5: And what will make you realize what the Crusher is?

6: ˹It is˺ Allah’s kindled Fire,

7: which rages over the hearts.

8: It will be sealed over them,

9: ˹tightly secured˺ with long braces.[1] 
	[1] Other possible translations: 1. “The Fire will be in towering columns.” 2. “They will be tied to long pillars.”
