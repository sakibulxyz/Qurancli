1: By the fig and the olive ˹of Jerusalem˺,

2: and Mount Sinai,

3: and this secure city ˹of Mecca˺![1]
	[1] " This passage refers to the land of figs and olives where Jesus (ﷺ) lived, Mount Sinai where Moses (ﷺ) communicated with Allah, and the city of Mecca where the Prophet (ﷺ) started his mission. A similar reference can be found in Deuteronomy 33:1, ˹Moses proclaimed:˺ “The Lord came from Sinai. Rising from Seir upon us, he [sic] shone forth from Mount Paran.” Seir is a mountain near Jerusalem, and Paran is a mountain near Mecca.",

4: Indeed, We created humans in the best form.

5: But We will reduce them to the lowest of the low ˹in Hell˺,

6: except those who believe and do good—they will have a never-ending reward.

7: Now, what makes you deny the ˹final˺ Judgment?

8: Is Allah not the most just of all judges?
