1: Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High,

2: Who created and ˹perfectly˺ fashioned ˹all˺,

3: and Who ordained precisely and inspired accordingly,

4: and Who brings forth ˹green˺ pasture,

5: then reduces it to withered chaff.

6: We will have you recite ˹the Quran, O  Prophet,˺ so you will not forget ˹any of it˺,

7: unless Allah wills otherwise.[1] He surely knows what is open and what is hidden.
	[1] Meaning, We will have you memorize the revelations and apply the rulings contained in them, unless one ruling is replaced by another. 

8: We will facilitate for you the Way of Ease.[1]
	[1] The Islamic way of life which brings about ease in this life and salvation in the next. 

9: So ˹always˺ remind ˹with the Quran˺—˹even˺ if the reminder is beneficial ˹only to some˺.

10: Those in awe ˹of Allah˺ will be mindful ˹of it˺.

11: But it will be shunned by the most wretched,

12: who will burn in the greatest Fire,

13: where they will not ˹be able to˺ live or die.

14: Successful indeed are those who purify themselves,

15: remember the Name of their Lord, and pray.

16: But you ˹deniers only˺ prefer the life of this world,

17: even though the Hereafter is far better and more lasting.

18: This is certainly ˹mentioned˺ in the earlier Scriptures—

19: the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
