1: Indeed, ˹it is˺ We ˹Who˺ sent this ˹Quran˺ down on the Night of Glory.[1]
	[1] It is also believed that the angels descend with all decreed matters for the whole year during that night (al-qadr also means ordainment or destiny). 

2: And what will make you realize what the Night of Glory is?

3: The Night of Glory is better than a thousand months.

4: That night the angels and the ˹holy˺ spirit[1] descend, by the permission of their Lord, for every ˹decreed˺ matter.
	[1] i.e., the angel Gabriel. 

5: It is all peace until the break of dawn.
